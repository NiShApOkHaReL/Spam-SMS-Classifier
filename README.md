## Overview
This project is focused on developing a machine learning model for the detection of spam and ham (non-spam) SMS messages. The project covers key steps such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and performance comparison among various machine learning algorithms.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Load the SMS dataset and remove unnecessary columns.
- Rename columns for clarity.
- Remove duplicate values.
- Verify the dataset's integrity, such as checking for missing values.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of spam and ham messages to understand class balance.
- Analyze the statistics of the text data, including character count, word count, and sentence count.
- Visualize common words in spam and ham messages using word clouds.

### 3. Text Preprocessing
- Perform text preprocessing, including lowercasing, tokenization, removing special characters, removing stop words and punctuation, and stemming.
- Prepare the transformed text for model training.

### 4. Model Building
- Build machine learning models using various algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and more.
- Evaluate the models using accuracy and precision.

### 5. Evaluation
- Assess the model performance based on accuracy and precision scores.
- Compare the performance of different algorithms.
- Select the model with the highest precision score, crucial for spam detection to minimize false positives.

### 6. Performance Comparison
- Compare the accuracy and precision of various machine learning algorithms.
- Visualize the performance of different models using bar plots.

## Results
- The project successfully builds and evaluates several machine learning models for spam SMS detection.
- A comparison of algorithms shows the best-performing model based on precision.
- The selected model can be deployed for spam detection in SMS messages.

This project offers a comprehensive approach to building a spam SMS detection system and serves as a valuable guide for similar text classification tasks.
